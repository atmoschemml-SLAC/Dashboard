### **About SLAC**
The SLAC community is an online space supporting scientists interested in learning about and applying machine learning and data science methods in their research. Because these methods are relatively new to the discipline, SLAC is designed to supplement the support scientists get from their own research groups and collaborators â€” many find themselves the first in their circles to use a particular algorithm.


### **About this repository**
This repository is used to ask/pose questions, raise interesting topics, share issues for codes, and have other discussions for members in the SLAC community.
